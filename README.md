Cross-platform desktop app with Tauri, Rust, and SvelteKit.

The demo app uses the YOLOv8 model for object detection, it uses opencv-rust to load the ONNX model and perform object detection. Tauri is the framework to build the desktop app, and SvelteKit as the frontend framework, Rust as the backend.
